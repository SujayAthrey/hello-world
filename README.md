# hello-world
This is my first repository

Description: I like to watch and play soccer, I have a pet dog named Lucky who is a 5 year old maltese and loves to take walks outside. I am a rutgers student learning Computer Science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick (freshman). I currently know java, not fluent... and I am learning web design which is essentially HTML, CSS, and JS(React Libraries and more).
